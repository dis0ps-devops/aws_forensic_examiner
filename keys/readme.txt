Use public key authentication whenever possible!

Ideally, have each forensic user provide their public key, then place in this folder with the following naming scheme:

<user_name>.pub


Where <user_name> is the user defined in vars/users.yml.

The two example users would have keys in this folder as follows:

forensic.user1.pub
forensic.user2.pub
